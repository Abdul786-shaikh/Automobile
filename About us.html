    <h2>Best Designs</h2>
    <p>Automotive design is the process of developing the appearance, and to some extent the ergonomics, of motor vehicles, including automobiles, motorcycles, trucks, buses, coaches, and vans.
      The functional design and development of a modern motor vehicle is typically done by a large team from many different disciplines included within automotive engineering, however, design roles are not associated with requirements for Professional or Chartered-Engineer qualifications. Automotive design in this context is primarily concerned with developing the visual appearance or aesthetics of the vehicle, though it is also involved in the creation of the product concept.</p>

    <h2>Better Mileages</h2>
    <p>Mileage is just one indicator of a vehicle condition. Theoretically, a vehicle that has covered more miles has more wear and tear, but  a car with 60,000 miles on the odometer can easily be in worse shape than one with 120,000 miles. Cars and trucks like to be driven. Parts that don’t get regular use can become brittle and break more easily. And a low-mileage car that hasn’t had regular maintenance can see more problems down the line. Overall, a high-mileage vehicle that is driven frequently and has been well-maintained will be a more reliable bet.</p>

    <h2>Customer Relations</h2>
    <p>Customer Service departments are assuming an increasingly central role in most sectors, from industry giants and medium-sized companies to small businesses and start-ups. The automotive sector is no exception, customer service in the automotive industry is very important. In fact, the industry is focusing more and more attention (and investments) to improve the relationship with customers.</p>
